The following example scripts are in the folder related to the Fast Imaging Pipeline

1. FIP_prototype.py  - to make an image data cube given the Measurements Set, creating one dirty image per unique observation time (all snapshots and natural weighting only)

2. FIP_prototype_slice.py - as above but includes time slicing (inverting only a part of snapshots) and uniform weighting scheme

3. make_mp4.py - to make MP4 animation given the image data cube3

4. FIP_PyBDSF_detection.py - to run BDSF point source detection

5. FIP_Aegean_detection.py - to run Aegean point source detection

6. FIP_cat_processing.py - to perform a cluster analysis to find the detections related to the different transient sources
